![Alejandro Diaz](/img/alex150.jpg)
Hello! 👋 I'm Alejandro Díaz, a Telecommunications Engineer with over 10 years of experience in the ICT sector.

My career has evolved from network and web application design, through technical and innovation management, to the technical and commercial management of development and integration teams with clients from different sectors. I have led R&D projects, developed proprietary hardware and software solutions, and participated in multiple technology platforms, both in industrial and residential environments.

I am passionate about IT networks, cybersecurity, the development of smart solutions, and the world of data science and artificial intelligence. I am currently looking for a role that combines strategic vision with technology, where I can contribute creativity, experience, and a passion for learning.

In addition to my professional life, I enjoy tinkering with home automation systems, automation, Home Assistant, and anything that involves integrating technology into everyday life.
